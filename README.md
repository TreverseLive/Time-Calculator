# Time Calculator

I developed this Time Calculator simply out of necessity. There were tons of time calculators out there, but I could never find one with everything I needed. So, I made it myself! This program features:

**Timeframe Calculator:** *Given two intervals of time in Day-Hour-Minute-Second format, this calculator will smash them together and give the resulting addition/subtraction of them, sorted and devised. It also features a handy "Rotate" button to reinput the results back into the equation! No need to retype it all!*

**Duration Calculator (12-Hour):** *How much time is in between these two intervals? This calculator will easily answer that question for you!*

**Hourly Rate Calculator:** *Knowing how much you should be paid is CRUCIAL. If you know how many hours you worked, as well as your hourly wage, you can easily calculate exactly how much you should be paid, down to the last second!*

**Date Calculator:** *How far apart are these two dates? Or, how long are these two dates, combined? This calculator will do that math for you!*
